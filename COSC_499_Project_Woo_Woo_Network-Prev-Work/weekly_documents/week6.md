## Week 6

### Issues to work on:
- Completed deploying front end locally on all our devices
- Work on project video, due Wednesday morning
- Complete reviews of other teams, due Friday at midnight
- Decide on whether or not we will recreate backend based off meeting with Kimberlee on Friday
- Meet with Kimberlee and previous team member to understand how their backend works.
- Ask previous project member about how they constructed their backend to simplify our process of making our own back end if we cannot get theirs to run locally. 
- October 13th: Video walkthrough of deploying database has been shared with us. We will use this video to try and replicate the process on our personal devices.

### Meeting with Kimberlee on October 15th @ 1:00pm:
- Introduced Amy Cheng for help on the technical side of things.
- Some teams have watched a walkthrough on the backend but havent had any success.
- Amy is going to set up her enviroment test the code out for own understanding.
- planned on meeting next monday or tuesday to finally decide if making our own backend is a better idea

### Things to hand in Friday October 15th:
